# Prediction-of-volatility-in-stock-movements-on-the-US-market

This challenge has been proposed by the CFM group, known for working in machine learning methods in finance: https://challengedata.ens.fr/participants/challenges/22/

The goal of this challenge is to predict the volatility on the US stock market for different products.
More precisely, we are given their volatilities and returns between 9:30 a.m and 1:55 p.m, and we want to predict the average volatility of each of these products between 2pm and 4pm.

The solution I provided ranked 4th in the public leaderboard.
